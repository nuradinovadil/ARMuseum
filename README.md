# ARMuseum


Our startup, ARs, has developed an innovative solution to tackle the common problem of waiting in queues at museums. We understand that time is a precious commodity, and we believe that waiting for the pleasure of experiencing art should be an enjoyable experience itself. Through our mobile app, we offer a range of solutions to enhance the museum visit for both visitors and museums. Our key features include:
Non-Artworks: We have introduced the concept of Non-Artworks, physical empty frames placed outside museums where people queue. These frames come to life through augmented reality (AR) technology. Visitors can scan a QR code using our app and instantly enjoy captivating artistic content, creating an interactive and engaging experience.
Dynamic Ticket Pricing: To optimize the queue experience, we have implemented a dynamic ticket pricing system. As the queue length increases, ticket prices adjust accordingly, incentivizing visitors to choose less crowded times. Meanwhile, ticket prices at the museum's office remain fixed. This system allows for a fair and efficient ticketing process while maximizing revenue potential for museums. The ticket prices can be adjusted in real-time based on various factors such as demand, time of day, day of the week, special events, and other relevant factors such as peak visiting hours, popular exhibitions. By analyzing visitor data and historical patterns, museums can identify peak and off-peak periods. During high-demand times, ticket prices can be set higher to capture the increased willingness of visitors to pay, while prices can be lowered during off-peak times to attract more visitors and optimize attendance. Dynamic pricing improves the visitor experience and can help manage crowd flow and alleviate congestion by encouraging visitors to choose different entry times. This improves the overall visitor experience by reducing overcrowding, long queues, and wait times, resulting in a more enjoyable and efficient museum visit.
City Exploration: We go beyond the museum visit by providing visitors with a curated list of suggestions for nearby restaurants, cafes, hotels, and other attractions. This feature encourages visitors to explore the entire city, enhancing their overall travel experience and generating additional value from our app. The City Exploration feature in our app can provide accurate recommendations on various criteria such as cuisine type, location, user reviews, ratings, and popularity. The app utilizes geolocation technology to suggest nearby restaurants based on the user's current location. This allows users to discover and explore restaurants in their immediate vicinity, making it convenient for spontaneous dining decisions.
